    "content": "\nPortMaster is a \"convenient\" script designed to facilitate the downloading and installation of ports for handheld devices. As the number of available ports has increased, the original interface has become progressively cumbersome. For the past few months we have been developing a new GUI.\n\nWe are delighted to present the first public beta the new PortMaster GUI.\n\n## Features (it has them)\n- Completely custom GUI using Python SDL2 bindings\n- Small size, only 3.8mb!\n- Port previews, we can really showcase the ports.\n- Cancellable downloads, accidentally started a 300mb download? Get out of here.\n- Filter ports by genre/porter/runtime\n- Localizations (We currently have English, Italian, French, and German), translators welcome!\n- Themes: Since it was possible with the custom GUI, we went for it.\nWe have a few themes at launch, but contributions are more than welcome.\nDefault Theme: comes in both light mode and dark mode\nZelda: LTTP Inspired theme\nFF VII: A beautifully done FF7 theme\nBasic Theme: A super barebones theme so you can get started designing your own!\n- Colour Schemes, themes can support multiple colour schemes for darkmode / lightmode / different colour ways.\n- Builtin theme downloader!\n\n## Nerdy features\n- Custom Sources: want to control your own ports repository? no worries!\n- Platform Hooks: PortMaster on raspberry pi?
