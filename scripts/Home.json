        "notes": "* Thanks to [Rubberduckycooly](https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly/RSDKv5-Decompilation) for the decompilation work that makes this possible.  Thanks to [TheGammaSqueeze](https://github.com/TheGammaSqueeze/RSDKv5-Decompilation) for the porting work.\n* Please note that the game comes preconfigured for displaying on a 640x480 device (ex. RG351V and RG353V/VS).  Unfortunately this truncates the menus a little but does not affect gameplay (the ring and lives hud are placed correctly).  If you go to Options then Video, you can force Fullscreen to On and restart the game and it will set the screen to fullscreen for widescreen devices but add black bars at the top and bottom of 4:3 screens like the RG351V.  Once you've made this change, you can't go back to 4:3 without either manually editing the settings.ini file within the sonicmania port folder and changing pixWidth to 320 and fullscreen to 0, or redownload the port through portmaster which will overwrite this settings.ini file with the default one provided in the port package that is preconfigured for 4:3.\n* To access DLC (Sonic Mania Plus), per the developer's [license requirements](https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly/RSDKv5-Decompilation/blob/master/LICENSE.md),  users need to compile this themselves. Thanks to romadu, the compile process has been made as simple as possible by providing a single GitHub repo that can be compiled on a device with ArkOS by following these instructions available [here](https://github.com/romadu/RSDKv5-Decompilation/blob/master/README.md#building-on-device-with-arkos)."

Just start Super Mario War from Ports in the emulationstation menu.\n\n**Netplay**: There's a netplay feature available with the portmaster version that supports network play between multiple units.  According to the author ([mmatyas](https://github.com/mmatyas/supermariowar/blob/master/docs/netplay.md)) of this feature, it is very much experimental so performance will vary depending on a a number of factors not limited to network latency, connection quality (2.4Ghz vs 5Ghz, vs Wired connection) and if attempting to play over Internet, lag and disconnects.  To use this feature: you can do the following:\n\n1. One of players has to run the server.  This can be done from the netplay menu provided when you launch Super Mario War from the PortMaster version.\n1. Server IPs can be added from the netplay menu from within settings.  The netplay menu will allow you to easily set Server 1 as your internal IP address, Server 2 as your external IP address.  You can also set alternative addresses for these servers as well.\n1. Make sure to start the server before you start Super Mario War.  Once started, you can join the server using your internal IP address.  The other players will need to join via your internal IP if playing on the same local network or your external IP if joining via Internet.\n    - Be aware that if playing over internet, the unit with the smw server started must have port forwarding on that wifi or wired router's configuration for UDP 12521 to point to the internal IP of the unit running the smw server.  If this is not done, Internet based players may not be able to join the smw server.\n1. Once connected, a room must be created with a name.  With the PortMaster setup, the x and y button can be used to just name the room x or y so the room can be setup and all players can enter the room and start playing.",
