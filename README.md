## Content and Theme

This repository contains the content and theme as currently used on the PortMaster web-site. Contributions are welcome with the reserved right to modify submissions to ensure consistency in look / feel and that it conveys a compatible language, tone, etc., those found here.

## Contributing

The easiest way to get started is to download one of the content snippets from under the `content` subdirectory. Here are a few pointers that may make contributions easier those just getting started:

* The document structure and format is defined by the built-in **export tool** within Wordpress. It is the simplest to import at this time and allows freedom for individuals to do so asynchronously.

* Simplicty over style is preferred and the content should be accessible to all, just like PortMaster ports. Accessibility guidelines are important, should be respected, and can be found [here](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/#accessibility-standards).

* If you are including custom CSS, JS, etc., please ensure it follows the standards as outlined [here](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/#language-specific-standards).

* If you have questions, you can reach out to the team who will provide assistence when able.
