## Content and Theme

This repository contains the content and the theme as used on our web-site. Contributions are welcome however, we maintain the right to modify submissions to ensure consistent look, feel and that it conveys the same language, writing style, etc., as the rest of the website.

## Contributing

The easiest way to get started is to download one of the content snippets from under the `content` subdirectory. Here are a few pointers that may make contributing easier for beginners:

* We use the document structure and format as created by the built-in **export tool** within Wordpress. It is the simplest for us to import at this time and allows us to do so on-demand on an individual basis.
* We prefer simple over style as we want the content to be accessible to all, just like our ports accessibility guidelines should be respected and can be found [here](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/#accessibility-standards).
* If you are including custom CSS, JS, etc., please make sure that it follows the standards as outlined [here](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/#language-specific-standards).
* If you have questions, you can reach out to the team who will provide assistence when able.
