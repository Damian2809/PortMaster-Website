# PortMaster Website

## Content and Theme

This repository contains the content and the theme as used on our web-site. Contributions are welcome however, we maintain the right to modify submissions as we see fit
in order to ensure that it all has a consistent look and feel and that it conveys the same intonation, writing style, etc., as the rest of the website.

### Contributing

The easiest way to get started is to downlaod one of the content snippets from under the `content` subdirectory. Here are a few pointers that may make contributing easier for beginners:
* We use the document structure and format as created by the built-in **export tool** within Wordpress. It is the simplest for us to import at this time and allows us to do so on-demand on an individual basis.
* We prefer simple over style as we want the content to be accessible to all, just like our ports Accessbility guidelines should be respected and can be found [here](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/#accessibility-standards).
* If you are including custom CSS, JS, etc., please make sure that it follows the standards as outlined [here](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/#language-specific-standards).
* If you have questions, you can always reach out to the team and we will assist as soon as we're able.
