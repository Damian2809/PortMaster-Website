<h3><a id="user-content-moonlight-nvidia-gamestreaming-app" class="anchor" href="#moonlight-nvidia-gamestreaming-app" aria-hidden="true"></a>Moonlight Nvidia Gamestreaming App</h3>
Instructions: PC Requirements and setup as follows:

PC Requirements:
A PC with an Nvidia 600 GPU or newer
<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/" rel="nofollow">GeForce Experience app</a>
<ol>
 	<li>You'll need to make sure your streaming PC and your rk3326 device with the supported linux distro are connected to the same network.</li>
 	<li>When you launch Moonlight from the ports menu, you'll be presented with a menu with 2 options, Start Streaming and settings. You'll want to go to settings first and choose the pair option.</li>
 	<li>You'll be presented with a screen asking for the name or IP address of your PC with the Nvidia Geforce Experience app installed.</li>
 	<li>Once you hit the ok button, you should be presented with a pairing dialog box on your PC.</li>
 	<li>Enter the 4 digit PIN displayed on your device into the pairing dialog box and click the Connect button.</li>
 	<li>By default, Moonlight is setup to stream Steam from your PC. There are other options available such as Dolphin if you have that installed and configured on your PC.</li>
</ol>
Notes:
<ul>
 	<li>To ensure that you have controls in your games while streaming, be sure to disconnect any game controllers from your PC and reboot your PC before you start your streaming session.</li>
 	<li>More information about Moonlight is available <a href="https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-docs/wiki">here</a>.</li>
 	<li>If you experience issues with the setup and launching menu functioning correctly, hitting start may resolve it or simply force close the port using the usual exit hotkey on ArkOS or supported linux distro for your device (RGB10 = Minus + Start, RK2020/RG351P/M/V/MP = Select+Start, Chi = 1 + Start).</li>
 	<li>For those that don't have an Nvidia vide card, there's an alternative PC client called <a href="https://github.com/loki-47-6F-64/sunshine">Sunshine</a>. I haven't tested it so I don't know how well it will work but there's been reports that it seems to work well.</li>
 	<li>To exit Moonlight when complete, you can press Select+Start+L1+R1 or simply use the exit hotkey for your device to get out of the app.</li>
 	<li>If you experience issues reconnecting to your PC, go to settings in the Moonlight app and unpair the PC then do another pair again.</li>
 	<li>There has been an instance where Moonlight would not work with a PC unless the HDMI connection was removed from the PC to a TV.</li>
 	<li>You can add more apps for streaming by editing the Moonlight.sh file and adding more apps between lines 167 and 173. Be aware that the entries are case sensitive.</li>
 	<li>Mouse control is only possible using the Rockchip platform in settings. That is only possible on the OGA, OGS, RGB10, and the RK2020 at this time. Holding start for about 2 - 3 seconds while using the Rockchip platform will switch to mouse mode. Hold Start for about 2 - 3 seconds again to switch back to gamepad controls.</li>
</ul>

Notes:
<ul>
 	<li>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly/RSDKv5-Decompilation">Rubberduckycooly</a> for the decompilation work that makes this possible. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/TheGammaSqueeze/RSDKv5-Decompilation">TheGammaSqueeze</a> for the porting work.</li>
 	<li>Please note that the game comes preconfigured for displaying on a 640x480 device (ex. RG351V and RG353V/VS). Unfortunately this truncates the menus a little but does not affect gameplay (the ring and lives hud are placed correctly). If you go to Options then Video, you can force Fullscreen to On and restart the game and it will set the screen to fullscreen for widescreen devices but add black bars at the top and bottom of 4:3 screens like the RG351V. Once you've made this change, you can't go back to 4:3 without either manually editing the settings.ini file within the sonicmania port folder and changing pixWidth to 320 and fullscreen to 0, or redownload the port through portmaster which will overwrite this settings.ini file with the default one provided in the port package that is preconfigured for 4:3.</li>
 	<li>To access DLC (Sonic Mania Plus), per the developer's <a href="https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly/RSDKv5-Decompilation/blob/master/LICENSE.md">license requirements</a>, users need to compile this themselves. Thanks to romadu, the compile process has been made as simple as possible by providing a single GitHub repo that can be compiled on a device with ArkOS by following these instructions available <a href="https://github.com/romadu/RSDKv5-Decompilation/blob/master/README.md#building-on-device-with-arkos">here</a>.</li>

<h3><a id="user-content-sorr-streets-of-rage-remake" class="anchor" href="#sorr-streets-of-rage-remake" aria-hidden="true"></a>SorR (Streets of Rage Remake)</h3>
Instructions: You'll need to provide your own sorr.dat file, mod folder, and palettes folder:
<ol>
 	<li>Obtain any version of SorR. You can use either the windows or linux/debian version it does not matter which.</li>
 	<li>Extract them /roms/ports/sorr (For RG351V if using SD2, extract to /roms2/ports/sorr instead). You should have a /mod folder, a /palettes folder, and SorR.dat file in this location in order for the game to work.</li>
 	<li>Then go to Ports, and launch SorR
<em>Note</em>: <del>If you experience a slowdown in gameplay after sometime, force exit the game (You can use the normal force exit hotkey combination for your device), then start the game again and it will start from the beginning of the last stage you were on and be full speed for a few more stages. It's the best workaround for the issue for now until someone can figure out and resolve the root cause of the slowdown.</del> [Fixed as of 10/6/2021]</li>

Instructions: Super Mario War files are already included and ready to go. Just start Super Mario War from Ports in the emulationstation menu.

<strong>Netplay</strong>: There's a netplay feature available with the portmaster version that supports network play between multiple units. According to the author (<a href="https://github.com/mmatyas/supermariowar/blob/master/docs/netplay.md">mmatyas</a>) of this feature, it is very much experimental so performance will vary depending on a a number of factors not limited to network latency, connection quality (2.4Ghz vs 5Ghz, vs Wired connection) and if attempting to play over Internet, lag and disconnects. To use this feature: you can do the following:
<ol>
 	<li>One of players has to run the server. This can be done from the netplay menu provided when you launch Super Mario War from the PortMaster version.</li>
 	<li>Server IPs can be added from the netplay menu from within settings. The netplay menu will allow you to easily set Server 1 as your internal IP address, Server 2 as your external IP address. You can also set alternative addresses for these servers as well.</li>
 	<li>Make sure to start the server before you start Super Mario War. Once started, you can join the server using your internal IP address. The other players will need to join via your internal IP if playing on the same local network or your external IP if joining via Internet.
<ul>
 	<li>Be aware that if playing over internet, the unit with the smw server started must have port forwarding on that wifi or wired router's configuration for UDP 12521 to point to the internal IP of the unit running the smw server. If this is not done, Internet based players may not be able to join the smw server.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Once connected, a room must be created with a name. With the PortMaster setup, the x and y button can be used to just name the room x or y so the room can be setup and all players can enter the room and start playing.</li>
</ol>
