## Installation

### Installing PortMaster

For ArkOS on supported devices, PortMaster was included with a recent online update.  You can locate it in the Options &gt; Tools menu.
For 351Elec/AmberElec, just unzip the contents of PortMaster.zip to your storage/roms/ports folder then run PortMaster.sh from the Ports menu in 351Elec.
For JelOS, it's been intergrated into their most recent releases.  Just launch from tools and enjoy!
If you don't have PortMaster there or need to install it manually, you can do the following:</p>

* Place the PortMaster folder in /roms/tools.  The .sh file **must** remain in the PortMaster folder!
* *For ArkOS on the RG351V, RG351MP, RG353M, RG353V/VS, or RG503,  if SD2 is being used for roms, installation must be in /roms2/tools/. The .sh file **must** remain in the PortMaster folder!

## Running PortMaster

* Run PortMaster from ArkOS, TheRA or RetroOZ through Options &gt; Tools &gt; PortMaster menu, 351Elec/AmberElec from Ports &gt; PortMaster menu
