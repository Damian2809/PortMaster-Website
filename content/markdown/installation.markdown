## Installing PortMaster

[Download](https://github.com/PortsMaster/PortMaster-GUI/releases/latest)

To install PortMaster download the PortMaster.zip from the link above, unzip it and place it in the appropriate folder for your CFW.

| CFW          | Location               |
|--------------|------------------------|
| AmberElec    | /storage/roms/ports/   |
| ArkOS        | /roms(or roms2)/tools/ |
| JELOS        | /storage/roms/ports/   |
| TheRA        | /opt/tools/            |
| UnofficialOS | /storage/roms/ports/   |

If your CFW is not listed above, it will most likely be in one of the above locations.

## JELOS

To get it to work on JELOS:

- Go to `Tools -> Start PortMaster` first then exit.
- Unzip PortMaster.zip and copy `PortMaster/` directory and all its contents into `/storage/roms/ports`.
- Restart EmulationStation
- You can now run `PortMaster` in the `PortMaster` directory.
- **WARNING**: If you do `Tools -> Start PortMaster` it will delete the `PortMaster.sh` and you will need to extract it from the zip again.

## Other CFW

For the other CFW it is as simple as:

- Unzip PortMaster.zip and copy `PortMaster/` directory and all its contents into directory listed above.
- **If you're using ArkOS**, you will need to move the `/roms(or roms2)/tools/PortMaster/PortMaster.sh` up one directory to `/roms(or roms2)/tools/PortMaster.sh`
